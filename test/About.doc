 My name is Yinka Ajiboye a member of the coding mums currently looking to transition into a Tech role specifically Devops in the next 6months as this would help me achieve my short term goal of switching career path and upskilling. Over the next 5 years, I would like grow continuosly in the field and evolve to be the best devops engineer in the world, earning in 8 figures and living my best life. 

 Some of the ways I intend to achieve this includes but is not limited to;

 1. Always looking for oppurtunities to add knowledge.

 2. Taking up challenges and trying to problem solve whenever the need arises.

 3. Being a part of a community of like minded individuals that can motivate me to do more e.g The Coding Mum.

 4. Try to give my best at all times.

 5. Stay determined in order to achieve my goal.
